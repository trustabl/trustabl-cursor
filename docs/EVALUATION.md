# Evaluating Trustabl on Cursor

This guide covers two things: **trialling Trustabl** to decide whether it earns a
place in your pipeline, and **reading the results** once it runs.

---

## What Trustabl evaluates

Trustabl analyses AI-agent codebases for reliability, safety, and security
defects. It inventories the agents,
tools, subagents, skills and MCP servers in a repository, then evaluates each one
against a rule pack covering ten ecosystems: Claude Agent SDK, OpenAI Agents SDK,
Google ADK, MCP, LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen AG2, Pydantic AI and
Vercel AI.

It looks for the failure modes ordinary code review misses, for example a tool
that shells out and can be prompt-injected, an agent session with no turn limit,
or an MCP tool that fetches a caller-controlled URL.

Rules are versioned separately from the engine and fetched at scan time from a
signed channel, so a scan picks up new detections without upgrading the binary.

---

## Trialling it

**1. Scan without gating first.** Run it in report-only mode on a repo you know
well. You are checking whether the findings are real, not whether the build
passes.

**2. Read the inventory before the findings.** If the tool and agent counts look
wrong, the scan is pointed at the wrong path or your SDK is not being detected.
A score computed over the wrong inventory is meaningless.

**3. Sample five findings and judge them yourself.** Open the files it flags. The
question is not "is this a bug" but "would we have wanted to know". False
positives cost trust; findings you would have fixed anyway are the signal.

**4. Then turn gating on.** Start at a `high` severity threshold so only serious
issues break the build, and tighten once the team trusts the output.

---

## Reading the results

### Readiness score

A number from 0 to 100. **Risk is simply `100 - readiness`.** The score is
weighted across the surfaces found, so a repo with one bad tool out of fifty
scores far better than a repo with one bad tool out of two.

**Do not read the score in isolation.** A high score over an empty inventory
means nothing was analysed, not that the code is safe. Check the tool and agent
counts first.

### Severity

| Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `critical` | Exploitable now, fix before shipping |
| `high` | Serious weakness, fix this sprint |
| `medium` | Real defect, schedule it |
| `low` | Worth improving, not urgent |
| `info` / META | Observations, **not defects** — an opaque agent, an unaudited SDK |

`info` and META signals never fail a build on their own. They exist so the report
is honest about what it could not evaluate.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | No findings at or above medium |
| `1` | Gated — findings crossed a configured threshold |
| `2` | Scanner or I/O error, or no usable rules |

**Exit 1 is a result, not a malfunction.** Exit 2 means the scan did not complete
and the output should not be trusted.

### Output files

| File | Use |
|---|---|
| `trustabl.json` | Full machine-readable result: inventory, findings, scores, rule provenance |
| `trustabl.sarif` | SARIF 2.1.0, for any SARIF viewer or code-scanning surface |

The JSON records `rules_version`, `rules_schema_version` and `rules_origin`, so
you can prove which ruleset produced a given result.

### Triage order

Fix in severity order, but use the **projected scores** in the report to decide
where effort pays off. They estimate the score if you resolved everything at a
given severity, so you can see whether clearing every `low` finding is worth it
or whether two `high` ones dominate the result.

Projections come from the same formula, not a re-scan.

---

## Gating

Any one of these can fail the run.

| Control | Effect |
|---|---|
| default | Fails on any finding at medium or above |
| severity threshold | Fails when the worst finding reaches the level you set |
| risk score threshold | Fails when risk reaches a number you set |
| strict | Lowers the bar to any finding of low or above |

A common progression is report-only, then `high`, then `medium` once the backlog
is clear.

## What Trustabl does not do

Worth knowing before you evaluate it, so the result is not oversold:

- **It is static analysis.** It reads code, it does not run your agent, so it
  cannot observe what happens at inference time.
- **A finding is a weakness, not a proven exploit.** Severity reflects the shape
  of the risk, not a demonstrated attack.
- **Coverage depends on detection.** If your SDK is not one of the ten supported,
  or your agents are constructed dynamically, they may not appear in the
  inventory. The report states what it parsed and what it skipped — read it.
- **An empty result is not a pass.** If nothing was found, verify the scanned
  path and that your SDK is supported before concluding the repo is clean.

---

## Running it here

Ask the agent in chat:

> Scan this repository with Trustabl and summarise the high-severity findings.

The agent calls the `trustabl_scan` tool. All parameters are optional: `path`,
`detectors`, `strict`.

Unlike the CI plugins this runs at **editor time**, before code is committed, so
the point is fixing findings as you write rather than gating a build.

## Where the results appear

| Surface | What you get |
|---|---|
| **Chat** | Severity table, readiness score, and the worst findings inline |
| **Workspace files** | `trustabl.json`, `trustabl.sarif`, `trustabl-report.txt` |
| **SARIF viewer** | Open `trustabl.sarif` to see findings inline on your code |

Because findings come back as structured data with file paths and line numbers,
the agent can act on them directly. "Fix the highest-severity finding" works.

Large scans return the worst 50 findings in chat to keep the agent's context
usable. The complete set is always in the files.

For a trial, scan a repo you know, then ask the agent to explain one finding and
propose a fix. That tests both the detection and whether the output is actionable.
